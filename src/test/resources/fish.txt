To what extent do you think people are influenced by TV advertisement?
Nowadays we can’t watch our favourite TV shows or film without irritating TV commercials.
Everyday a lot of people forced to face with this. And we can’t imagine how advertising influences our solution when we want to buy something.
In point the fact that the man needs a minimum of things to exist. But if we look on women's cosmetic bag or cupboard
we will see hundred things the need for which we can doubt. It’s just the result of advertising. Our desire is often false.
Many companies through advertising with catchy jingle or recognizable slogan inspire people that they need exactly their product
to promote their business. For example majority of woman have a lot of clothes which they buy and never dressed or it happened
but only a couple of times. It proves that they don’t really need it. Maybe, one day, this woman saw TV commercials in which someone
very beautiful model walked in fashion clothes, and they wanted to dress like her.
On the other hand, people aren’t stupid, and they must understand that advertising is a trick. And many can say that they aren’t believe
in what they see on TV or other sources of advertising , they can control their mind when time to buy something become. In this situation
people control their consciousness, but we also have a subconscious on which the action of advertising is directed. When constantly see
the same commercial we not suspect how this affects our subconscious. It enters in our brain. We think that we make the decision ourselves
but it isn’t true.
To sum up, people are influenced by TV advertisement to a great extent unaware of it. I think if we don’t watch so much
TV and begin read a book for example, situation will change.
